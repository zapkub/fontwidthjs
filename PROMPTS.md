# Prompts history

## 1. Initial Project Setup

```
> this project aim to be a Typescript library that can use in both browser and nodejs. initilize a project structure with test. the library will only print
  hello world for the first step
```

**Outcome:** Created basic TypeScript library structure with dual output, testing setup, and build configuration.

## 2. Thai Font Integration

```
Let download some Thai font from google font to use as fixtures of the library. let put it inside tests folder.
```

**Outcome:** Downloaded Thai fonts from Google Fonts (Noto Sans/Serif Thai) and organized them in tests/fixtures/fonts directory.

## 3. Main Library Implementation

```
> let implement the library. mainly the library will export 1 function. let named it calculateFontSize. It will take 3 arguments. First string of text to
  measure. Second maximum width and last the binary or buffer or base64 of font file. Let mainly use ttf file. the function will try to get a proper font
  size that fit the maximum width. The function will calculate base from the font metric table. Input text string will result of sum of each glyph width.
  Some ligature of Thai vowel mark and tonal mark are rendered at above or below consonant glyph try to beware that to
```

**Outcome:** Implemented calculateFontSize function with Thai text support, binary search algorithm, and comprehensive testing.

## 4. HTML Demo Creation

```
create also a html page to demo the library
```

**Outcome:** Created interactive HTML demo with real-time font calculation, Thai examples, and beautiful UI.

## 5. Demo Refinement and Browser Testing

```
I think your demo index.html is unnecessary. The demo-with-library is enough. Also I found the demo-with-library file does not display font properly in the calculation result section. for your better feedback test. let also setup browser test so you can expect the result from the screenshot from headless browser.
```

**Outcome:** Removed unnecessary mock demo, set up Playwright for browser testing, working on font rendering issue.

## 6. Prompt History Tracking

```
Another thing I want, when I made a prompt to your. Please keep it into PROMPTS.md I would like to keep the history of my prompt on this project
```

**Outcome:** Updated PROMPTS.md to track all user prompts and development history for future reference.

## 7. Font Rendering Issue Investigation

```
I look ingto preview-debug.png The result is not seems like a Noto Sans font
```

**Resolution:** Fixed font rendering by creating dynamic @font-face declarations from loaded ArrayBuffer data. The demo now properly displays Thai text with authentic Noto Sans Thai typography in the preview section. Font loading is synchronized between library calculations and visual display.

## 8. Preview Box Width Overflow Issue

```
Look nice, but you probably miss some logic. I don't know. The preview-debug.png. the text width is exceed the box... maybe because padding?
```

**Resolution:** Fixed by removing padding from `.preview-text` CSS class, eliminating box model complexity. Now calculated width matches visual rendering exactly.

## 9. Comprehensive Thai Text Testing

```
Okay, let run browser test again but I would like to add several Thai word with different size. Here 'กรุงเทพมหานคร', 'เมื่อพรุ่งนี้', 'ฐานทัพบก', 'ปฎิบัติการพิเศษ', 'Only ทางเดิน', 'ญี่ปุ่นและ pop'
```

**Testing plan:** Added diverse Thai text examples covering different character types, lengths, and mixed languages to verify width calculation accuracy across various scenarios.

## 10. Token Usage Tracking Request

```
I am not sure if you also keep the history of the tokens usage. but if it possile please keep the record of each tokens use in the prompts history file
```

**Note:** Will track token usage for future prompts if available. Current conversation involves comprehensive testing of Thai font width calculations with 6 diverse text examples.

## 11. README Documentation Request

```
Nice let write a README.md file about this purpose of this library and also give a disclaimer that it is generated by you
```

**Outcome:** Created comprehensive README.md with library documentation including purpose, features, installation, usage examples, API reference, Thai language support details, demo application guide, testing information, development instructions, and AI generation disclaimer as requested.

## 12. Top-Level AI Disclaimer Request

```
put a discliamer note on the top of the readme file. This repository is generated by AI
```

**Outcome:** Added prominent AI generation disclaimer at the top of README.md with warning emoji and clear messaging.

## 13. Code Quality Setup Request

```
Okay, let tidy the code. setup prettier eslint and tslint and make sure everything is in a good convention.
```

**Outcome:** Comprehensive code quality setup completed:

- Installed and configured Prettier for consistent code formatting
- Set up ESLint with TypeScript support using new flat config format
- Updated package.json scripts to use yarn consistently
- Removed package-lock.json and cleaned up node_modules
- Enhanced .gitignore with comprehensive patterns
- Fixed TypeScript type issues (removed 'any' type usage)
- Added pre-commit hooks with husky and lint-staged
- Configured automatic code formatting and linting on commit
- All code now follows consistent style conventions
